notice that the Primary and Lower Secondary schools contribute to this schocking results,whereas higher secondary institutes are still having a good percentage of electricity supply,that is the reason why the results have slightly gone up.\nAlso the regions which have 100% of their schools equipped with electricity facilities are basically Union Territories and have less,but well developed
